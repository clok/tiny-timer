TinyTimer.pm
==========
Very simple timer module for perl

SYNOPSIS
------

Simply create a new TinyTimer object:

```perl
my $timer = TinyTimer->new;
```

Then "start" and "stop" in your code for time deltas.

```perl
$timer->start;
.
.
<CODE>
.
.
$time->stop;
```

On "stop" the "delta" property is populated and can be used.

```perl
print $timer->delta;
```

Output:
```
0.0003447273118
```

That's it!

####new
Constructor for TinyTimer

####start
